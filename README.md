# HSCAP

This script was developed to capture files that contain the password of a Wi-Fi device, it is a simple and quick process of deauthentication and capture.
To get the Wi-Fi password of a router it is necessary to decrypt the handshake file generated by HSCAP and for this process we recommend [HSPCD](https://github.com/midnightsonne/HSPCD).

### Prerequisites

These packages are needed to run HSCAP, if you don't have them you can install each one yourself or **let HSCAP install these packages for you**.

```
mdk3          - sudo apt-get install mdk3
mdk4          - sudo apt-get install mdk4
aircrack      - sudo apt-get install aircrack-ng
xterm         - sudo apt-get install xterm
xset          - sudo apt-get install x11-xserver-utils
```

### Installing

You can install HSCAP with just these commands:

```
cd /folder/where/HSCAP/is/located/at/

sudo bash install.sh -i
```
Also, you can **run HSCAP with "hscap" directly on console after you have installed it**.

### You Can Edit The Script Yourself

There's six arguments that you can edit yourself for better use of the HSCAP script...

```
# - Amount Of Time Given To The HandShake Capture For It To Kick Clients From The Network - Default value "12"
TimeAttack=12

# - Amount Of Time Given To AiroDump For It To Capture The HandShake - Default value "24"
TimeCapture=24

# - Set XTerm Geometry Values ( Width And Height ) - Default value "100x25"
XTermGeometry=100x25

# - Which Attack Mode To Use - "mdk3" "mdk4" "aireplay" - Default value "mdk3"
AttackMode=mdk3

# - Update The Latest Packages - Default value "Yes"
UpdatePackages=Yes

# - Update HSCAP To The Latest Version On GitHub - Default value "Yes"
UpdateScript=Yes
```
Each one has a very specific task on HSCAP, so don't leave them with nothing on.
